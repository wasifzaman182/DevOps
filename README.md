# DevOps
# Before DevOps
  1) The development team build the code and hands it over to the operations team for deployment. 
  2) The operations team deploy the code and shares the feedback with the Development team.
  3) This process consumes time, or you can say it delays the process of completing the project

# DevOps purpose 
  1) Merge the Development Team and the Operations team.
  2) The development team write the plan according to the Project features.
  3) Start the development and put it in a single place like Git (version control). It may contain different versions.
  4) Use build tools like **Maven** or **Gradle**.
  5) Do the testing like Selenium Express.
  6) Then the Ops tasks start
  7) Deploy the code and operate
  8) For operation, tools are used like **Ansible**, **Docker**, **Kubernetes**
  9) Then monitor the application/deployment using tools like **Nagios**
  10) Last but not least, **Jenkins**, to perform all these operations automatically and combine the Dev and Ops teams.
        . Pipelines are created  to manage all the processes before going to production.

### Planning 
  1) The planning phase of DevOps is one of the most important phase, which decide the failure or success of the project.
  2) In this phase, all stakeholders come together and decide what needs to be built, how to build, and how to deliver.
  3) Before DevOps, the software pipeline was considered a straight line, but DevOps changed it to a continuous and dynamic process.
  4) Also called linear process (2D) and continuous process (3D)
